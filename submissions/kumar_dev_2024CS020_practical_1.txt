# Practical 1: Basic Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
In this practical, I explored the fundamentals of prompt engineering. This is a relatively new field that focuses on designing effective prompts for Large Language Models.

## Task 1: Simple Prompts

### Basic Prompt Example
```python
prompt = "What is machine learning?"
```

This is a simple prompt but lacks specificity.

### Improved Prompt
```python
improved_prompt = "Explain machine learning in 2-3 sentences suitable for a high school student"
```

Better because it specifies: audience, length, and complexity level.

## Task 2: Prompt with Context

```python
context_prompt = """
You are a helpful Python tutor.
The student is a beginner.
Explain how to create a list in Python with 3 examples.
"""
```

This shows role-setting which is useful.

## Task 3: Few-shot Example
```python
few_shot = """
Example task: Translate English to French
Input: "Hello" -> Output: "Bonjour"
Input: "Goodbye" -> Output: "Au revoir"
Input: "Thank you" -> Output: ?
"""
```

## Observations
1. Specific prompts give better results
2. Adding context helps
3. Examples guide the model

## Conclusion
Prompt engineering is important for working with LLMs effectively. I learned the basics but need more practice with complex scenarios.
