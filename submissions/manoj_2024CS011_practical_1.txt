# Practical 1: Basic Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
This practical covers the basics of prompt engineering.

## Part 1: Simple Prompts

### Prompt 1
**Prompt:** "What is machine learning?"

**Response:** Got a basic definition of machine learning as computers learning from data.

**Analysis:** Simple prompt gave simple answer.

### Prompt 2
**Prompt:** "Summarize this article in 3 sentences."

**Response:** Received a 3-sentence summary.

**Analysis:** The constraint worked as expected.

## Part 2: Prompt Refinement

### Before
"Explain AI"

**Issues:** Too broad.

### After
"Explain artificial intelligence to a beginner, focusing on supervised learning with examples."

**Improvements:** Added audience, focus area, and example requirement.

## Part 3: Testing

### Test 1: Different Prompts
Tried asking the same question in different ways. Got different responses based on phrasing.

### Test 2: Adding Context
Adding more context to prompts gave better, more relevant answers.

## Observations
- Clear prompts work better
- Specific instructions help
- Context matters

## Conclusion
Prompt engineering improves when you are specific and provide context.
