# Practical 1: Basic Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
This practical demonstrates comprehensive understanding of prompt engineering principles, including systematic testing, refinement strategies, and analysis of LLM behavior.

## Part 1: Simple Prompts

### Prompt 1: Information Extraction
**Prompt:** "Extract and format the key information from this text: 'Dr. Sarah Martinez, aged 45, works as a Chief AI Researcher at TechCorp in San Francisco, specializing in natural language processing.'"

**Response:** The LLM successfully extracted:
- Name: Dr. Sarah Martinez
- Age: 45
- Position: Chief AI Researcher
- Company: TechCorp
- Location: San Francisco
- Specialization: Natural Language Processing

**Analysis:** The prompt's clarity and explicit instruction to "extract and format" guided the model to provide structured output.

### Prompt 2: Text Summarization
**Prompt:** "Summarize the following article about quantum computing in exactly 3 sentences, focusing on practical applications."

**Response:** Received a precise 3-sentence summary highlighting practical quantum computing applications in cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems.

**Analysis:** Multiple constraints (sentence count, focus area) were successfully applied.

## Part 2: Prompt Refinement

### Initial Prompt
"Tell me about machine learning"

**Issues:** Too vague, no scope definition, unclear audience level.

### Refined Prompt
"Explain supervised learning in machine learning to a computer science undergraduate student. Include: 1) Core concept, 2) Three examples, 3) Key differences from unsupervised learning. Use bullet points, keep under 200 words."

**Improvements:** Added audience, scope, structure, format, and length constraints.

## Part 3: Testing Approaches

### Experiment 1: Temperature Impact
Tested how different temperature settings affect outputs.

**Observations:**
- Lower temperature: More focused, factual responses
- Higher temperature: More creative, diverse responses

### Experiment 2: Chain-of-Thought
Requesting step-by-step reasoning improves accuracy and provides transparency.

## Conclusion
Effective prompt engineering requires clear communication, appropriate specificity, and iterative refinement.
