# Practical 1: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

## Overview
This document covers my exploration of prompt engineering basics.

## Task 1: Basic Prompt
```python
prompt = "Write a poem"
```

This is too vague and lacks specificity.

## Task 2: Better Prompt
```python
better_prompt = """
Write a short haiku about spring.
Use traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure.
Include imagery of cherry blossoms.
"""
```

This is more specific with clear requirements.

## Task 3: Code Generation Prompt
```python
code_prompt = """
Create a Python function that:
- Takes a list of numbers
- Returns the average
- Handles empty lists gracefully
Include docstring and type hints.
"""
```

## Conclusion
Prompt engineering requires practice and iteration. Better prompts lead to better results.
