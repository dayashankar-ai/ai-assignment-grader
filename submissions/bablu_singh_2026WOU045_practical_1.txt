# Practical 1: Basic Prompt Engineering Exploration

## Introduction
This practical explores the fundamentals of prompt engineering for Large Language Models. I will demonstrate various prompt techniques learned in lectures 1-3.

## Part 1: Understanding Basic Prompt Structure

### Simple Prompt Analysis
A basic prompt is a straightforward instruction:
```python
basic_prompt = "Explain photosynthesis"
```

**Issues with this prompt:**
- No specified audience
- No length requirement
- No format specified

### Improved Prompt with Context
```python
improved_prompt = """
Role: You are a biology teacher.
Audience: 5th grade students
Task: Explain photosynthesis
Requirements:
- Use simple language
- Include an analogy
- Keep it under 100 words
"""
```

**Why this is better:**
- Clear role assignment
- Defined audience helps calibrate complexity
- Specific requirements guide output

## Part 2: Prompt Techniques Demonstrated

### Technique 1: Role-based Prompting
```python
def create_role_prompt(role, task):
    return f"""
    You are a {role}.
    Your task is to {task}.
    Respond in a professional manner appropriate to your role.
    """

# Example usage
prompt1 = create_role_prompt("senior Python developer", 
    "review this code for security vulnerabilities")
```

### Technique 2: Few-shot Learning
```python
few_shot_prompt = """
I want you to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.

Examples:
1. "Great product, love it!" -> positive
2. "Terrible experience, never again" -> negative  
3. "The product is okay" -> neutral

Now classify:
"This exceeded my expectations!"
"""
```

### Technique 3: Chain of Thought Prompting
```python
cot_prompt = """
Solve this step by step:
Question: If a train travels 120 km in 2 hours, what is its average speed?

Think through:
1. First, identify what we know
2. Then, apply the relevant formula
3. Finally, calculate the answer

Show your reasoning at each step.
"""
```

## Part 3: Testing Different Prompt Variations

I tested the same task with different prompt styles:

| Prompt Style | Response Quality | Specificity |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Basic | Generic | Low |
| With Context | Better | Medium |
| With Examples | Best | High |

### Testing Code
```python
import openai

def test_prompt(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Test different prompts
results = {}
for prompt_type, prompt in prompts.items():
    results[prompt_type] = test_prompt(prompt)
```

## Part 4: Error Handling
```python
def safe_prompt_request(prompt, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return test_prompt(prompt)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Specificity matters**: More specific prompts yield more useful responses
2. **Context is crucial**: Providing role and audience improves relevance
3. **Examples help**: Few-shot learning guides the model effectively
4. **Iteration is key**: Refining prompts through testing improves results

## Challenges Faced
- Initially prompts were too vague
- Had to learn to balance specificity with flexibility
- Understanding token limits and their impact

## Conclusion
This practical taught me the fundamentals of effective prompt engineering. I learned that well-structured prompts with clear context and examples produce significantly better results than vague instructions.
