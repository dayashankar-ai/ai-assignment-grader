# Practical 1: Basic Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
This practical is about prompt engineering. I will show some prompts and responses.

## Part 1: Simple Prompts

### Prompt 1: Information Extraction
**Prompt:** "Tell me about AI"

**Response:** AI is artificial intelligence. It is used in many things like computers and phones.

**Analysis:** The prompt worked and gave me answer about AI.

### Prompt 2: Summarization
**Prompt:** "Summarize machine learning"

**Response:** Machine learning is when computers learn from data.

**Analysis:** Got a short answer.

## Part 2: Prompt Refinement

### Initial Prompt
"What is deep learning?"

**Issues:** The prompt is simple.

### Refined Prompt
"What is deep learning and how is it different from machine learning?"

**Improvements:** I added more question to the prompt.

## Part 3: Testing Approaches

### Test 1
I tested the prompt with different words. Sometimes I got different answers.

### Test 2
I tried asking in different ways. The answers changed a little bit.

## Observations
- Prompts work
- AI gives answers
- Different prompts give different answers

## Code Example
Here is a simple code I wrote:

```python
def ask_ai(prompt):
    # This function asks AI
    response = ai.ask(prompt)
    print(response)

# Testing
ask_ai("What is AI?")
```

Note: The code has no error handling and is very basic.

## Conclusion
Prompt engineering is important for getting good answers from AI. I learned that prompts should be clear.
