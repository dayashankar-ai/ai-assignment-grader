# Practical 1: Basic Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
This practical covers the fundamentals of prompt engineering and demonstrates understanding of LLM interactions.

## Part 1: Simple Prompts

### Prompt 1: Information Extraction
**Prompt:** "What are the three main components of machine learning?"

**Response:** The LLM explained:
1. Data - the training dataset
2. Model - the algorithm/architecture
3. Training - the learning process

**Analysis:** Clear, direct question yielded structured response.

### Prompt 2: Summarization
**Prompt:** "Summarize the concept of neural networks in 2 sentences."

**Response:** Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological brains, consisting of interconnected nodes. They learn patterns from data through adjusting connection weights during training.

**Analysis:** Constraint on sentence count was respected.

## Part 2: Prompt Refinement

### Initial Prompt
"Explain AI"

**Issues:** Too vague, no context, unclear scope.

### Refined Prompt  
"Explain artificial intelligence to a first-year computer science student. Focus on: 1) Definition, 2) Types (narrow vs general AI), 3) One real-world example. Keep it under 150 words."

**Improvements:** Added audience, structure, scope, and length constraint.

## Part 3: Testing

### Experiment 1: Temperature Settings
- Low temperature (0.2): More consistent, factual responses
- High temperature (0.8): More creative, varied responses

### Experiment 2: Few-shot Learning
Providing examples in the prompt improved response format consistency.

## Conclusion
Effective prompts are specific, structured, and include appropriate constraints for the desired output.
